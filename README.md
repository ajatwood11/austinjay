# README
A database-powered quote generator with a mobile-first design, using the Ruby on Rails framework, HTML, and CSS. Users can create new quotes and add them to the database via the contribute link at the top of the page. Upon clicking the link, a  Bootstrap dropdown menu will appear. After the user creates the quote, it will be added to the database and will appear on the screen. Users can press the red circle at the top left and the app will randomly output a quote, along with ID number of the quote. Users can also click on the about link at the top right to learn more about me. On that page you can click on 'Austin Atwood' to go to my GitHub. They can also click on 'Here' to learn more about the University of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp course. To get back to the main page they can click on the red circle. At the bottom of the main page, users can click on 'Austin Atwood' to view my portfolio. Below that link is another link to learn more about the bootcamp.
